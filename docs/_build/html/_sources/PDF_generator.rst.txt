PDF\_generator module
=====================
This module will create a pdf file containing all the images from an experiment, the sample name (prefix) of the images is used to group the images onto separate pages, and the image number is included below each image.

Usage
-----

The simple usage of this is summed up below::

      from SimpliPyTEM.PDF_generator import pdf_generator
      #This generator gives a list of the images
      Images = [x for x in os.listdir('Path/to/images/directory') if x[-3:]=='jpg']
      
      #A pdf can then be generated by::
      pdf_generator(Images, Title='Experiment title', Notes='Here are some notes about the experiment.....', directory='Path/to/images/directory' )



PDF files generated from this can be easily shared. However, if movies are required consider using html_writer
